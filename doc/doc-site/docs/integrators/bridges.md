## Bridging USDC (LayerZero)

### What is Stargate and why is it relevant?

Stargate is a cross-chain liquidity protocol that allows users to swap assets between different chains with low fees and fast transaction speeds.
Bridges are a critical component of the decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape, as they allow users to access a wider range of financial products and services.

### Prerequisites

Before we begin, you will need to have the following:

- A wallet with USDC from any one of the Stargate-supported chains
- A browser with the given wallet extension installed
- An Aptos wallet

### Steps to bridge USDC (LayerZero) into Aptos

1. Go to [The Aptos Bridge](https://theaptosbridge.com) website.
1. Connect to Stargate with the wallet from your non-Aptos chain.
1. Select the "From" and "To" tokens.
   In this case, select "USDC" (USDC on your given chain) for the "From" token and "USDC" on APT for the "To" token.
1. Enter the amount.
1. Click on the "Bridge" button.
1. Review the transaction details and click on the "Confirm" button.
1. The bridge will be executed and your wrapped USDC (LayerZero) coins for Aptos will be deposited into your Aptos wallet.
