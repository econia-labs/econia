## General

As an [Aptos]-native project, Econia is designed from the ground up to leverage [Block-STM] and the [Move] programming language.
In particular, Econia is optimized for parallel execution across markets, such that transactions for different trading pairs operate on non-overlapping regions of global state.
With additional access controls for global resources like [the registry], the result is a hyper-parallelized settlement engine with maximum throughput.

## This section

The documentation in this section provides a high-level technical overview of Econia's system architecture, intended to be read in order.
Throughout the documentation there are links to assorted data structures and functions from Econia's auto-generated [Move module] documentation files.
For example: [`OrderBook`].
