# Security

Econia has been independently audited by three firms, and all [audit reports] are public:
Move source code is audited through commit [`8148afe`] (tag [`v4.0.2-audited`]), via three initial audits and a complimentary followup audit.

Additionally, Econia will be deployed on Aptos mainnet under a multisig account, as discussed in [issue 33].

Econia is currently undergoing planning for a sequence of testnet rehearsal deployments and on-chain parameter updates, so stay tuned for more security updates!
